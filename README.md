# Bleak-54

Contrary to popular belief, this theme is not a modified bleak theme, but an extension of the default Casper. I believe this is a much cleaner and simpler code

# Credits

- Casper theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) can be found under the Ghost's [releases](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/releases) page.
- The cover video, as well as the HTML code for it, were downloaded from [Coverr](http://www.coverr.co/)
- For the navigation transition effect, I was planned to use the [PageStackNavigation](https://github.com/codrops/PageStackNavigation) as a base, but ended up using a simpler (and faster) CSS
- The comics were taken from my [codrops](http://codepen.io/mochiron/pen/QyJVrZ), with SVG for the characters from [Hand Drawn Goods](http://handdrawngoods.com/)
